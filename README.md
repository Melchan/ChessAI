# ChessAI

This is updated version of other Chess Game i made. I will use ui from the
old game, but because i have to  make so heavy modifications to my chess board
class. It is  probably easier to rewrite all the logic in previous chess game 
from scratch. I also feel it is also a good change for me to see old code in 
a new light.  

I will use this chess game in my shcool project https://github.com/TiraLabra/2016-kevat-periodi3/wiki

I will add ai.
